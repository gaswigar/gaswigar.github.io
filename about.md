**Thanks for visiting my blog!** I am a Statistician at RTI International and I am currently pursuing a Masters of Statistics at North Carolina State University (NCSU). I graduated from NCSU as a triple major in Mathematics, Economics, and Statistics in spring 2019. I have been working at RTI since graduation. During the past year I have worked on multiple research intiatives including the following:

*Small Area Estimation of Criminal Offense Counts <br>
*Automated Interview Error Detection through NLP and Signal Processing <br>
*Analysis of Census of Medical Examiners and Coroners Data
