How is the course going so far?  

I think the course is going pretty well so far. I took the undergraduate data science course and was concerned that this might be repetetive. 

Learning tidyverse programs

What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?

I am grateful that we are covering git and rmarkdown. GitHub is used at RTI but mainly by data scientists not by statistical staff. 
Using github on project 1  orced me to use it instead of casually reading an article every month or so.


Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!
