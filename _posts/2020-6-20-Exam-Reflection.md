How is the course going so far?  

I think the course is going pretty well so far. I really appreciate the organization and planning that went into this course. Full time school and work is made manaegable by knowing every deadline and how to direct my time and efffort. 

What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?

I am grateful that we are covering git and rmarkdown. Using github on project 1 forced me to learn how to use the basics of GIT instead of casually reading an article every month or so. Also, I think R markdown is an extremely useful tool that I will begin using on some of my projects. I also enjoyed the topics on API's and databases. I think it would be nice if we learned some of the advanced tidyverse syntax such as accross() and other functions that help with dynamic programming. But, at the same time we obviously need go through the tidyverse basics first. 

Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!)

Not that I can think of! I am liking the course so far.
