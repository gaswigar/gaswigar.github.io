What is being a data scientist is about? 

Creating valuable insights from processed, analyzed and visualized data through modern software tools. 

What are the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

A good data scientist is a statistician, computer scientist, and a domain expert. Many data scientists are specialized in one of these domains. However, knowledge of all three is necessary to create be productive. The responsibilities of a data scientist include:
o	Wrangling data into a usable structure. 
o Inspecting and cleaning data.
o Fitting statistical models to analze data and understand patterns. 
o Creating digestable visualizations.
o Communicating insights in a clear, jargonless, and accurate manner.

What are the differences/similarities between data scientists and statisticians?  

•	Data Scientist
o	Use R, Python, and SAS. 
o	Work with large and complex data types (Audio, Text, Images). 
o Concerned with model accuracy and acheiving 
	
•	Statisticians 
o	Use SAS, R, and Stata. 
o Work with smaller files.
o Concerned with correct statistical inference. 

Where do I fall and why?

Well, the easy answer here is Statistician. Given that is my title, undergraduate major, and masters track. However, when I apply the descriptions above I find my role is project dependent. For my work on crime data, international development, and public health I find I work with small datasets and my primary objective performing the most unbiased and accurate statistical tests.
However, working with large scale audio data and data collection systems I serve as a data scientist. I use signal processing and other data techniques to analyze copious data found within RTI's data collection systems. My goal within these processes is to create an accurate predictive models.
