[Here is my link to my second project](https://github.com/gaswigar/ST-558-Project-2)

During my project I:
* Visualized patterns between sentiment, subjectivity, and channel with the number of shares. 
* Created a Boosted Tree model of the binary share variable.
* Fit a stepwise selected logistic regreesion model.
* Removed high leverage points so that the model is not biased.
* Used the youden point of the ROC curve to classiffy the predictions 
* Automated my report for each day. 

* what would you do differently?

I would finish each section instead of working on the whole project at one time. Skipping in between different parts of the projects takes time to reacquaint myself with my prior work. On the next project I will try to work linearly and finish one part before moving onto the next. 

* what was the most difficult part for you? 

I like to work by trial and error with R markdown. Waiting for the models, especially the boosted tree, to run each time was a huge pain in the butt. It was time consuming. 

* what are your big take-aways from this project?

My big takeaways is that effort results in percent improvement and not much more. Whenever, I try different training parameter or tried other  modelling techniques I didnâ€™t see a large improvement. I felt like I spent a lot of the time working to increase model accuracy a few points. Also, modelling with large amounts of variables and data will take a long time!
