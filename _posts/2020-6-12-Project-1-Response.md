LINK TO PROJECT 1: https://github.com/gaswigar/ST558-Project-1

During my project I:
* Discussed JSON data is and why its important.
* Provided examples of accesssing an API.
* Demonstrated how to process JSON data from an API into a usable object.
* Created visualizations of the points, assist, penalty minutes, and other summary statistics of the best hockey players of all time.
  * Noticed how dominant how wayne gretsky was especially in passing and setting up teammates. 
* Analyzed performance averages by draft pick number.
  * Found that draft picks past 60 are all realtivley similair in value of ppg. 
  * Position doesnt seem to have an impact on ppg for forwards. 
* Looked at how the number of draft picks from other countries and the USA have fluctuated over time. 
  * Many of the players in the NHL are canadian. 
  * There hasnt been a large change in the number of US players drafted over time.
* Visualized career statistics by players from the most common countries. 
  * Many hall of famers are from canada. But this could be explained by total number of players. 
  * Sweden has higher assit to goals ratios.
  
what would you do differently?

I would pull in data from another data source where you could see individual season statistics from each player. Then you could see how there progress changed over time and make more interesting analysis. Also I think that creating one large function is better than many different functions because this seems cleaner. But I might try things the other way to see what I like more. 

what was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part of this was structuring the data. In particular looking at the number of people drafted from each country. I think there might have been a better way for me to create the dataframe without row binding the two tables. Another difficult part was mentally processing the data. There are so many variables accross these datasets that it took time to sit and understand them. Even with the help of other functions viewing the data take time.

what are your big take-aways from this project?

My largest takeaway from this project is that it takes time to explain things in an understandable manner. Much of the time I feel that data science articles explain what they are doing but dont explain why. They dont mention why they use JSON, why APIs are nice to have, and why there code is written. Explaining the "whys" of a project takes time and understanding but also leads to the reader learning.
